# Reactol

Reactol provides a set of simple abstractions that allow one to write reactions to messages. It doesn't shove any ```IEventHandler<T>```, ```IHandle<T>```, or ```IMessageHandler<T>``` down your throat. Use the declarative style in-the-box instead.

It's on NuGet already: [Reactol](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Reactol/)
